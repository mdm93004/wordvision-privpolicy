At WordVision, we take the privacy of our users very seriously. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Discord bot, which uses The Discord API and OpenAI API.

## What Information We Collect

The only data we store in our own database are snowflakes (For example: User IDs, Server IDs, etc) and the relevant information, such as an image link or what your prompt was. We use this information to store information vital for our service to operate correctly. 

For example, when you favorite an image, data such as the prompt you used, how many likes you have, what style you used, and of course the image you favorited, are all stored.

Some commands also send data to a private Discord channel, such as your username or your generated images. We use this data to review user reports and check for bad actors that may be violating our Terms of Service.
